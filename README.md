# Hotel_booking_analysis
# Project Overview
This project is a hotel booking system developed using Python's Pandas library for efficient data manipulation. It aims to optimize the hotel booking process and drive business growth by extracting actionable insights and implementing data-driven solutions. The project also includes a Power BI dashboard that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor and analyze the hotel's performance.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze hotel booking data and extract actionable insights to optimize the hotel booking process.

# Data Preprocessing
  In this project, we conducted extensive data preprocessing to ensure the quality and integrity of our hotel booking dataset. Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data analysis project as it helps us clean, organize, and structure the data for effective analysis and modeling. Below, we outline the key data preprocessing steps performed:
1. Data Loading: We started by loading the raw data into our Python environment using libraries like pandas. This step allowed us to access and manipulate the data for further processing.

2. Handling Missing Values: We identified and addressed missing values in the dataset. This included strategies such as imputation (filling missing values with meaningful data) or removal of rows/columns with excessive missing data, depending on the nature of the data and the analysis requirements.
